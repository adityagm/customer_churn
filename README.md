# customer_churn
telecom database when processed with Logistic Regression would predict the loyalty of the customer.

The customer churn dataset is private hence cannot be released, and it contained much fewer training samples than I expected, hence the best model to implement the churn prediction was a logistic regression model. 

The regularized logistic regression using the ‘liblinear’ library, ‘newton-cg’, ‘sag’, ‘saga’ and ‘lbfgs’ solvers have predicted with similar accuracy. Hence either of them could be used for the training.
